# hello-world
Following the "Hello World" Github introduction guide. 

Hello small segment of the world that is reading this.
I am an envirionmental scientist and hydrogeologist. 
Most of my code work has been for my work at the University of Maine, School of Earth and Climate Science, and my current position with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Remediation and Waste Management. 

I like R, and would like to learn more Python and some Javascript. 
I also like breakfast foods. Trees are nice too. I dislike messy data. 

For now I want to learn github so I can share and better manage my R projects, which include a couple fairly complex Shiny Apps, the development of which ought to be better organized. 
I also have some useful R scirpts and functions for any other hydrogeologists out there looking to explore and visualize data.
